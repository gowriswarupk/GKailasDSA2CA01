Fruit Analyser is the first CA project of the Data Structures Module in Y2 Sem2 for college.

## Pre-requisites:

   Users should ensure that they have the following steps completed prior to running the program to esnure smooth workflow:

- JavaFX lib along with the path to in (in VM options)
- Java SDK 18+

## Tests/ Troubleshooting

- several tests are included to run checks
- one error that may arise in few cases is the system lags due to wrong order of execution of methods. Try-catch methods are enabled to
  counter this, but if needed, best to click on find-clusters in between each operation to operate smoothly.
